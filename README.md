# ComputerVision

This app contains some basic computer vision samples using open cv for android (http://opencv.org/platforms/android.html). 
There are 2 different sections available: Feature detection and motion. 

## Feature Detection
All kernels, feature detectors etc. can be conv. with the image separately.
So you can see, how every filter, detector etc. changes the result.
The following filter, feature detectors etc. are available:

 - Gabor filter
 - Gaussian blur
 - Canny edge detector
 - Harries corner detector


## Motion
Contains motion analysis using x/t transformation and one of the following filter:
 - Energy of gabor (left, right, static or flicker)
 - 9-Tap filter
